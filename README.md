# Back_Propagation

Backpropagation (backward propagation) is an important mathematical tool for improving the accuracy of predictions in data mining and machine learning. Essentially, backpropagation is an algorithm used to calculate derivatives quickly

In the previous repo we saw the perceptron algorithm could not solve the XOR_dataset because it was not linearly separable, so we had to write the back propagation 
to solve this issue.
